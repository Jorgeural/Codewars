Description:

My washing machine uses L amount of water to wash X amount of clothes. For every 1 unit increase in clothes, the washing machine will use 10% more water to clean (i.e. For X = X + 1, L = L * 110%.

Write a function howMuchWater (JS)/how_much_water (Python) to work out how much water is needed if you have a N amount of clothes. The function will accept 3 parameters - howMuchWater(L, X, N) / how_much_water(L,X,N)

My washing machine is an old model that can only handle double the amount of X. If N > 2X, return 'Too much clothes'. The washing machine also cannot handle any amount of clothes less than X. If that is the case, return 'Not enough clothes'.

The answer should be rounded to the nearest 2 decimal places.

function howMuchWater(L,X,N){
  if(N > X*2){
    return "Too much clothes";
  } else if ( N < X) {
    return "Not enough clothes";
  } else {
    var liters = L;
     for (var i = 0 ; i < ( N - X); i++){
       liters *=  1.1;
     }
     return Number(liters.toFixed(2));
  }
